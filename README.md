# Hi Everyone!
Recently, my peers and I attended an industrial talk which is given by the ex-CTO Clarity Techworks and the employees of the Clarity Techworks. Their talk was really influential and thought-provoking as it contains a lot of things that we needed to master before we step in to our career in the future. They taught about the Job Scope, Technology they used, skills that needed to enter this competitive field and many more about technologies. Personally, i have learned a lot about the mindset of the company in choosing their employees. For instance, I would say that companies tend to hire those with a good character and discipline rather than taking those with higher marks but with no integrity. This is what has been said by their ex-CTO and deep down it really make sense! This is because skill can be learned anytime as time goes by but a good character should comes from their heart naturally.

Thank you!
